## Add a Customer  
In order to keep track of customers and payments, our system should have a function for adding new customers. A user should be able to use our system’s interface to input a customer’s name, address, email, phone number, preferred method of payment, and any other additional information that may be helpful. The user must be validated by the system using a password before he/she can access customer information. The system should also warn the user if someone with the same name already exists in the system.
