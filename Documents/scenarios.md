## Add a Customer  
In order to keep track of customers and payments, our system should have a function for adding new customers. A user will click a button to add a new customer and then input the customerâ€™s name, address, email, phone number, preferred method of payment, and any other additional information that may be helpful. The user will then click a save changes button to add the customer to the system. The user must be validated by the system using a password before he/she can access customer information. The system should also warn the user if someone with the same name already exists in the system.

## Create Invoice
Create an invoice allows a sales rep to create an invoice and send it at the same time. The sales rep will select who the invoice should be billed to from a drop down list of current customers. The customer's information is displayed in the invoice fields regarding customer information. The sales rep will then enter in the product or service and the amount. After all the appropriate fields are created, the sales rep will click either create, or create and send. The create button adds the invoice into the system. The create send takes an additional step of adding the invoice to the system and emailing the customer the invoice.
